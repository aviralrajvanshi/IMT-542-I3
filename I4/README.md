Must utilize Google Collab to access/manipulate this.

# Pros and Cons of each method:
1. API connection methods (for sites A and B):
- Pros: Real-time data access, security authentication, scalability, flexibility to acquire data subsets (300 rows instead of 30,000)
- Cons: Time consuming setup compared to direct file input (such as with csv), requires the 3rd party to update/upkeep the information, updates to ensure adherance to API version changes

1. CSV Connection Methods
- Pros: Simple and compatible with most systems, Not as high of a knowledge barrier as with APIs/other tech.language based methods, good for one time use/non frequent updates use, and east to manually edit and review
- Cons: Higher risk of human error, data validation is harder, data type support is less than others, real-time data is a struggle, encryption issues with files
